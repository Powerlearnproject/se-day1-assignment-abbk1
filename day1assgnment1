enhances security, and facilitates innovation. By following systematic methods, software engineering helps reduce costs, improve efficiency, 
and maintain scalability, making it a cornerstone of successful software development in today's tech-driven world.

Q2: Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer:
1: The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): This milestone introduced a systematic approach to programming that emphasized the use of loops,
conditionals, and subroutines, replacing the chaotic "spaghetti code" of earlier times. Structured programming made software more readable,
maintainable, and less error-prone, laying the foundation for modern programming practices.
2: The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by organizing code into
reusable objects that represent real-world entities. This approach enhanced modularity, code reuse, and maintainability, leading to more complex 
and scalable software systems. Languages like C++ and Java popularized OOP.
3: The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s): Agile methodologies transformed software engineering by promoting iterative development, 
collaboration, and adaptability. Agile practices, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasize customer feedback, continuous improvement,
and the ability to quickly respond to changing requirements, which are critical in today’s fast-paced technology landscape.

Q3: List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer:
Planning: This initial phase involves defining the project's scope, objectives, and feasibility. It includes resource allocation, 
risk analysis, and developing a high-level project plan to guide the development process.

Requirements Analysis: In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered from stakeholders. These requirements define what the
software should do, covering functional and non-functional aspects, and serve as the basis for the design and development phases.

Design: The design phase involves creating the architecture of the software. This includes high-level design (system architecture) 
and detailed design (data structures, algorithms, interfaces). The design serves as a blueprint for the coding phase.

Implementation (Coding): During this phase, the actual code is written based on the design documents. Developers create the 
software using the chosen programming languages and tools, following the coding standards and guidelines.

Testing: After coding, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs. This phase ensures that the software meets 
the requirements and is free of defects. Testing includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

Deployment: Once the software is tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment where users can access and use it.
This phase also includes training users, setting up the environment, and handling any necessary configurations.

Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for issues, updated with new features,
and patched to fix bugs. Maintenance ensures that the software continues to meet users' needs over time.

Q4: Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer:
Waterfall Methodology
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) must be completed before the next one begins.
It follows a strict order: Planning → Requirements Analysis → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
There is little to no overlap between the phases.

Advantages:
Structured Process: The clear, linear process is easy to understand and manage.
Documentation: Each phase produces detailed documentation, which helps in maintaining the system and onboarding new team members.
Predictability: Timelines, costs, and outcomes are well-defined early in the project.

Disadvantages:
Inflexibility: It’s difficult to make changes once a phase is completed, making it less adaptable to changing requirements.
Delayed Testing: Testing only happens after the development phase, which can lead to the discovery of significant issues late in the process.
Customer Involvement: Limited customer feedback is gathered until the project is near completion.

Appropriate Scenarios:
Stable Requirements: Suitable for projects with well-understood, stable requirements where changes are unlikely.
Regulated Industries: Ideal for projects in industries like healthcare, defense, or aerospace, where rigorous documentation and strict adherence to process are required.
Large-Scale Projects: Works well for large projects that need a high level of control and where all stakeholders agree on the requirements upfront.

Example:
Developing a banking software system with clearly defined requirements and a need for extensive documentation and validation.

Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of small, functional pieces of the software.
It involves continuous feedback and adaptation through short development cycles called "sprints" or "iterations."
Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and XP (Extreme Programming).

Advantages:
Flexibility: Agile can easily adapt to changes in requirements, even late in the project.
Continuous Testing: Testing is integrated throughout the development process, leading to early detection and resolution of defects.
Customer Involvement: Continuous customer feedback ensures the product aligns with user needs and expectations.

Disadvantages:
Less Predictable: Due to its flexible nature, it can be harder to predict timelines, costs, and outcomes.
Requires Experienced Team: Agile requires a highly skilled and self-organized team capable of handling frequent changes and making decisions on the fly.
Limited Documentation: Documentation is often minimal, which can be a challenge for maintenance and onboarding.

Appropriate Scenarios:
Evolving Requirements: Ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change frequently, such as in startups or innovative projects.
Customer-Centric Projects: Best for projects where regular customer feedback and involvement are critical.
Rapid Development: Suitable for projects that need to deliver functional software quickly, like web or mobile app development.

Example:
Developing a social media platform where features and user expectations are constantly evolving and require quick adaptation.
